            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi there. When people ask you who you are, what do you say? What makes you you?
                What is your purpose? 
            </p>
            <p>Here, I'll walk you through my life journey so far, and by walking with me, I hope you'll 
                understand yourself better too. 
            </p> 
            <h3 class=h3i>Take 5 minutes and recall 3 images that represent your roots, your background, your childhood influences, 'where you're coming from' when 
                you act and speak. Then ask yourself why those images are important to you. How do they 
                influence your decisions?
            </h3>
            <p>3 images that represent my background are:</p>

                Studio art taught me to observe the littlest details around me. It 
                encouraged me to explore, to go wild with my ideas and have fun in the process. 
                YouTube showed me that creativity is for everyone, that anyone 
                can edit and upload to create impact. Teaching gave me another purpose in life...

            <p>My interests led me to build my own major around Art & Ed-Tech at NYU. There, I 
                made interdisciplinary connections between humanity, art, design, the world wide web (WWW), 
                and education, and came in contact with marketing and entrepreneurship. 
                I took a 14-hour plane ride to Shanghai and tinkered with interactive media arts projects:

            <p>Tatsuya plays with scale, making analogies between daily-use objects and larger experiences. 
                Ogilvy breathes ingenuity into IBM's campaign my making ads functional. 
                Duchamp pokes fun at who determines what is art by declaring a urinal a piece of art. 
                Tiravanija wonders if anything inside a museum can be deemed art.
                All of these disparate works are connected by creativity, the ability to tie disparate 
                things together and see things in a new light.

            <h3 class=h3i>Connect the dots between your experiences. 
                Identify recurring themes in your life, what's most important to you? 
                Understand what matters. Understand your values. 
                Understand your underlying motivation. How will these affect what you choose 
                to do next?

            <p>What gets me up every morning is creativity. I research the web for new ideas. 
                I encourage others to explore the world through designing strategies and content that educate, entertain, and inspire.
