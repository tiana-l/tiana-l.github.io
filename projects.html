                <p><b>Context:</b> June, a personal contact and financial advisor, offered to set aside time to guide me through financial basics. 
                    Realizing that many upcoming college graduates could benefit from June’s financial info session, 
                    I suggested a programming collaboration with NYU CAS’ Student Council. 
                    June also needed help redesigning her presentation slides and LinkedIn. </p>

                <p><b>Brand Discovery:</b></p>
                <p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClFPRt3PYmM&ab_channel=BrandingbyGarden">brand</a> is your social identity. 
                    What do you want others to know about you? 
                    What do you want others to see you as? 
                    What do you stand for? 
                    What makes you unique? 
                    Branding is about <a href="https://99designs.com/blog/logo-branding/what-is-branding/">managing the perceptions people have about you</a> 
                    or your company, using communication tools like logos, visual language, 
                    tone, emotive language etc. A good brand uses these tools coherently 
                    across all touch points to convey the brand's benefits, evoke a positive emotional response, and to differentiate itself from competitors, 
                    thereby making the brand relevant to follow, buy from, or invest in.
                </p>
                <p>Brand discovery is the process of gathering information on your 
                    brand’s company, customer, and industry to inform the most 
                    competitive, best-fitted brand strategy for you. Data can be 
                    gathered from respected research firms, purchased from market-specific 
                    research outlets, sourced from trade publications, analyzed from internal 
                    social media metrics, collected using survey tools, or scraped real-time 
                    on the internet. The data is then analyzed to understand who your target 
                    customers are, how they think and what they want (in turn how you 
                    communicate what you provide), how your competitors have been enticing your 
                    targets and filling your targets’ needs, and how your brand can appeal to 
                    your targets better. For June’s purposes, I will be conducting a brief 
                    brand discovery, but <a href="https://medium.com/s/how-to-build-a-brand/lets-talk-about-brand-discovery-d626a5f3570b">here</a> 
                    is an amazing article that dives deeper into customer and competitive research.
                </p>
                <p><i>Discovery meeting</i></p>
                <p>*Disclaimer* 
                    I had the advantage of knowing June personally, however, this 
                    demonstrates how important it is to know your client and spend a 
                    day with them (ethnographic research). A personal brand should feel 
                    like your client’s own skin, while empowering your client to speak 
                    his/her/their voice.
                </p>
                <p>I first bulleted salient points about June’s personality. 
                    This could be called the start of the ‘understand the company phase’. 
                    Get to know the person/firm’s core values and interview all 
                    stakeholders (only June here) on what they think the company does. 
                    Make sure everyone is on the same page as to what they want the company to 
                    represent. Key points I picked out for June:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confident, knows her stuff</li>
                        <li>Generous/giving when it comes to financial advice</li>
                        <li>Genuinely eager to help with what she knows</li>
                        <li>Loves food, is a good cook, likes cute things</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Product: Next, I considered what her business is, her product, her short and long term goals. 
                    June provides financial advice, therefore, she needs to be professional. 
                    But personal finance is a very intimate matter, and the trust she builds 
                    with her clients needs to last. Trust can be built through more than just 
                    professionalism, and June's story as a mom trying to educate herself and her 
                    daughter to ensure her daughter is financially prepared to succeed makes June 
                    a caring, trustworthy advisor.
                </p>
                <p>Need/Pain point: I discovered June's pain point when I saw her struggle with 
                    technology used for design and when she reached out to me to 
                    help design a new set of presentation slides. She also needed graphic assets that  
                    were consistent and more than standard, ugly sample designs.
                </p>
                <p>Solution: My goal was to make it super simple for June to use my templates. 
                    My design solutions needed to be appealing for 2021, easy to use, and 
                    flexible enough for her needs. 
                </p>
                <p><i>Customer research</i></p>
                <p>I reached out to some of June’s past clients to get a sense of:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why did they reach out to June in the first place (initial attraction point)?</li>
                        <li>What did they need the most help with (clients’ pressing problems, emotional investment)?</li>
                        <li>What do others have to say about June (who is June to them)?</li>
                        <li>What do others want when it comes to financial advisors (qualities June needs to display)?</li>
                        <li>What do others think June’s strengths are?</li>
                        <li>What did they want more of (or less of) from June (improvements)?</li>
                        <li>Why would they choose June over other advisors (June’s competitiveness)?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>As an added benefit, I asked for permission to use their words as testimonials for her LinkedIn page.</p>
                <p>Customer research can be done very meticulously and procedurally. 
                    Data on customers’ demographic, behavioral, transactional, and 
                    psychographic information can be analyzed. While this doesn’t 
                    apply to June, site traffic, visits and repeat visits, remarketing, 
                    PPC campaigns, email and CRM data, social media, and marketing data can also 
                    be analyzed.
                </p>
                <p>Demographically, June’s past clients are age 40+, Asian, married with 
                    family, middle class, New Yorkers. After multiple one-on-one meetings, 
                    they purchase one or two hefty financial products when they feel the 
                    need to plan for their kids or when they’re thinking about retirement. 
                    Among the insurance policies June sells, Index Universal Life, Annuity, 
                    and Long Term Care are popular. June has a very niche audience, found 
                    mostly through her own network. However, June’s focus on middle class 
                    family members is a potential avenue of expansion. 
                </p>
                <p>Educating young adults 
                    and parents with little financial knowledge comes naturally to her as a 
                    mom turned financial advisor. Clarifying the characteristics of June’s 
                    current audience gives her a better idea of ideal customers she can 
                    reach out to beyond her network. This also informs the design of her brand, 
                    which needs to appear friendly and approachable to middle class family 
                    members who aren’t familiar with financial jargon.
                </p>
                <p><i>Competitive Research</i></p>
                <p>
                    At the moment, June finds most of her clients from connections and 
                    word of mouth. One-to-one financial advising cases often come through 
                    personal networks, are personalized to each client, and are difficult 
                    to scale. June doesn’t have much data on her clients, nor is she 
                    looking to find leads digitally, therefore, competitive research was minimal and inconsequential. 
                </p>
                <p><b>Story/Positioning:</b></p>
                <p>For English or Mandarin speaking New York middle class family 
                    members, June provides financial advice on insurance policies 
                    in an approachable way that places the client’s concerns, goals, 
                    and wellbeing first, and gives the client the tools to confidently 
                    make financial decisions.
                </p>
                <p><b>Initial Design Research:</b></p>
                <p><i>LinkedIn</i></p>
                <p>First, research was done on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-voices-2020-meet-professionals-driving-todays-roth/">LinkedIn top voices in Finance</a> and 
                    <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jrose/2020/02/18/top-9-millennial-youtube-channels/?sh=154fb3c63406">top finance youtube channels</a>. 
                    Most professionals wore neutral professional attire for their profile photos and featured 
                    recent achievements or company related graphics in their cover photos. 
                    An interesting trend was that the younger professionals (especially on youtube) 
                    appeared to be more design conscious, unique, or liberated in their aesthetics. 
                    For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GrahamStephan/about">Graham Stephan</a> 
                    shows off his fancy car, 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/thefinancialdiet/featured">The Financial Diet</a> adds millennial 
                    pops of color, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NateOBrien/featured">Nate O’Brien</a> 
                    sticks to his minimalist brand.
                    In their bios, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/camharvey/">Campbell Harvey</a>, 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghuram-rajan/">Raghuram Rajan</a>, and 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oghenerukevwe-odjugo-9716a9140/">Oghenerukevwe Odjugo</a> 
                    take the most formal approach, referring to their multitude of scholarly accomplishments in the 3rd person. 
                    The closest professional in likeness to June would be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fidelitydenisechisholm/">Denise Chisholm</a>, 
                    who is inviting, more personal, and, “a proud mom of two….”</p>
                <p>June’s brand should be professional, but not rigidly professional. There should be an element of warmth that shines through her role as a mother and advisor. Her cover photo can be of the Transamerica logo, the company she works for, or a graphic about learning and finance. Her profile photo should sport her in formal attire, but at her desk or under a tree to make it more inviting. Unlike the finance youtubers who are young millennials, speaking to other millennials/gen-Zers in a relatable way, using generational slang, June is older and not part of that culture. Therefore, to have her use a more balanced tone and appeal to parents first (then as an advisory figure to their children) would make more sense.</p>

                    <b>Case Overview: </b>Interactive Media Arts (IMA) is a new New York University (NYU) undergraduate program that teaches students to use art, technology, media, and design to create interactive, creative experiences. Because it's a new program, IMA lacks a visual identity that encompasses its unique interdisciplinary approach and speaks to its learners' extraordinary potential. My task as a designer was to create a logo that represents IMA's brand.

                <p>
                    <b>Problem Statement: </b>Design a logo that best represents IMA's incorporation of interaction, media, and arts, students' creativity and collaboration, and the community's ability to create extraordinary new opportunities.

                    <b>Brand Audit: </b> First, a brand audit was done with students in the Design Fundamentals class and from my personal experience with IMA. After generating a word web, salient associations were pulled out and focused on. My primary design goals were to communicate IMA as a place of potential, expression, design, and digital experiences.

                    <b>Ideation: </b>Sketching was used as a tool to explore as many concepts as possible. I gravitated towards designs that incorporated references to the digital world (cursors, switches, buttons), but which also communicated the potential to create something new, something great.

                    <b>First drafts: </b> 4 concepts were chosen for critique and further conceptualization. (From top left), 1 was chosen for its reference to digital switches, which makes users want to interact/slide the button and speaks to the opportunities users open up when attending the program. The logo works at different scales and can even be programmed to create dynamic experiences on the web. 2 was a homage to the subway system that connects NYC together, and the collaboration between students at IMA. 3 plays on the idea of a blinking text cursor as the gateway to expression. 3 also has potential to be pushed further, using the acronym IMA as a pun, dynamically changing the logo to: I'm an artist, I'm a hacker, I'm a designer etc. 4 maintains legibility yet abstracts the type IMA into an electric circuit board. Everything is connected, which is a double representation of IMA's community and also that connectivity is integral to working digital experiences. 4 can use color gradients to emphasize the moving of electrons and the generation of sparks and new ideas.

                    <b>Color pass: </b>A variety of colors were tested with first draft concept 1. Primary colored gradients were tested to symbolize IMA's playfulness and relevance to modern times (Instagram popularized the gradient trend). NYU purple was chosen as a dominant color to stay on brand. Contrasting colors were tested but discarded due to the resemblance to the Golden State Warriors. User testing was done, with students from Design Fundamentals commenting on their favorite button and why.
                </p>
                <p><b>Final result: </b>The purple, white, purple NYU color palette was chosen because it most clearly communicated that it was a digital switch and because it remains on brand for NYU.
