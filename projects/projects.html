        <p>The Summer of 2019, I interned at DCTV and had the opportunity to shoot my own documentary.
            As every Asian American experience is different, I decided to document the lives of family friends and friends. 
            My goal was to deep dive into childhood experiences of those my parents' generation and of those of my generation to
            truly learn who these people are and what experiences shaped their being. The resulting interviews left
            me astonished, as if I was meeting these people all over again.

        <p>As curriculum creator for <a href="https://www.edifyprojects.com/">Edify</a>, a nonprofit educational organization providing entrepreneurial skills to NYC highschools, I created 
            an outline and slideshow to teach the concept of design thinking.

        <p>Always forget your keys? Meet pesKey bot, a reminder bot with a bit of sass. 
            Now, your partner never has to wave their arms in defeat or scream at you to take your keys.
            pesKey bot does that for them.
        </p>
        <p>How pesKey bot came into being</p>
        <p>pesKey bot was inspired by Beauty and the Beast's Lumiere. We wanted to make an object come to life, give an 
            object its own personality. We hoped to create an object users would have a deeper level of interaction with.
        </p>
        <p>Interaction is the receiving, processing, and communication of information between two or more parties
            /objects. pesKey bot increases human object interaction by giving pesKey bot, an object, with more ways to sense and 
            communicate with humans. pesKey bot is able to process your distance from it and whether you took your keys or not, and 
            communicate different messages accordingly. 
        </p>
        <p>For further implementation, we hope to create a design that makes pesKey's key holder function
            more obvious and be able to add more sassy messages that pesKey bot can use to remind you to take your keys.
